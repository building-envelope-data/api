## Test your contribution

Please format and test your branch before commits.

Format your branch with [Prettier](https://prettier.io). If you use docker, run `make shell` to drop into a shell within a fresh Docker container. You can then run `make format` to format the code.

Verify that your commits pass the following tests:

- [ ] Run `make compile` to verify that all schemas are valid against the specification of GraphQL and JSON Schema.
- [ ] Run `make example` to verify that all examples are valid against the schemas.
- [ ] Run `make test` to verify that all tests from the folder `/valid/` are valid and all tests from the folder `/invalid/` are invalid against the schemas.
