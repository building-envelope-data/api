The API specification is mainly intended for software developers. It is being developed with the following design goals:

1. Facilitate re-use of the data schemas by keeping them modular.
1. Facilitate automated use by minimizing the number of valid variants.
1. Enable representation of all optical and calorimetric data which is currently relevant for BPS.
1. The meaning of a valid data set will be unambiguous.
1. The API should enable efficient data exchange.
